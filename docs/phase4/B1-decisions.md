# Phase 4 decisions (B1)

Decisions B1 made during Phase 4, numbered D4-n. Phase 3's are in `docs/phase3/A1-decisions.md`, which ends with D3-13. The Phase 4 briefs are in `docs/agent-handoffs.md`, "Phase 4 task briefs". Where a decision here differs from a brief, the decision wins.

## D4-1: the owner accepts Phase 3, and Phase 4 is issued (owner)

Date: 2026-10-27.

**What happened.**
- After the A-to-B handoff, B1 asked the owner once what they wanted checked or changed before accepting Phase 3.
- At 18:26Z the owner answered: "Start phase 4 and all work."
- B1 reads that as acceptance of the Phase 3 exit with the conditions it states, and with no further check requested.

**Recorded:**
- `docs/phase-3-exit.md` is marked owner-accepted.
- The Phase 4 briefs are issued: ADR-0008's items 1 and 2, the carry-over and hygiene list, and the order and first exit gate.
- Items 3 to 6 stay outlines. Each gets a full brief only after the item before it passes its gate.

**The Phase 3 conditions carry into Phase 4:**
- gate item 1's owed checks, released to B6 (D4-6);
- #176, #177, #181 and #182, plus relay PR 2 (B5);
- the collector's state replace (B3, D4-3);
- HR-11's absolute bound (B4 with B5).

**What does not change.**
- Every endpoint stays on the simulator, on loopback.
- H-01 to H-15 and Q3 are not run.
- No result is `hardware-verified`.

## D4-2: change approvals take their signer and nonce from the C7 envelope, and an approver is a per-key allowed kind (P4-A3)

Date: 2026-10-27. Sources: B3's ack (#221, #228), A3's answers on #221, and A1's concurrence on #221.

**The rulings:**
1. **The `node.change_approval` payload** carries:
   - the asset;
   - the hash of the baseline it approves a change against;
   - the window's start and end;
   - the reason.

   The nonce, the expiry and the approver come from the C7 0.4 signed envelope, which is already signed and replay-checked. They are not repeated in the payload. The P4-A3 brief is corrected to match.
2. **C7 0.6 adds an allowed-kinds list to each pinned admin key.**
   - A key pinned without the list keeps exactly the C7 0.5 kinds. It never gets `node.change_approval` or `node.baseline_ack`, so existing installs fail closed.
   - B3 documents the enrolment step in its admin-key design note.
3. **Refusing a key that may not sign a kind.**
   - The refusal stays `admin_unverified`, with a new `Check` value.
   - The check runs after `signature` and `binding` and before `replay`, so a refused approval does not spend its nonce.
   - The decision still takes a `collector_seq`, and the node writes the denied record. That is V-M2's "refused and recorded".
4. **"The approver is not the person who made the change" is out of scope for Phase 4.** Nothing observes who changed a relay until engineering access (R2) exists. C7 0.6 records it as a limitation that R2 can close.

## D4-3: carry-over hygiene starts now, and `govulncheck` gets its own workflow

Date: 2026-10-27.

1. **The collector's state replace (B3).** The POSIX-semantics rename in `replaceFile` falls back to `MoveFileEx` only when the call fails as unsupported (`ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER`, `ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`, `ERROR_INVALID_FUNCTION`), never by Windows version. The fallback is logged once per process. A sharing or access error is never a reason to fall back: it goes to the bounded retry (about 500 ms) and then the fail-closed break.
   - `publishInstallKey` moves onto the same helper and keeps its rule: no published key, no start.
   - Evidence for the crash test is labelled "process kill on the hosted runner; power-loss durability not shown".
   - B1 had held this merge until the owner said what they wanted checked before accepting Phase 3. The owner asked for nothing further (D4-1), so the hold is lifted. The PR merges under D2-13 with B6's and B5's reviews.
2. **`govulncheck`.** It goes in its own workflow, `.github/workflows/govulncheck.yml`.
   - Triggers: `pull_request` with D3-13's Markdown filter, and a weekly schedule.
   - B3 writes it, with `govulncheck` pinned. B6 reviews it (D3-10).
   - B1 owns and authorizes it, as with `ci.yml`.
   - `ci.yml` stays at ten jobs.
   - When the workflow merges, D2-13's merge rule becomes "every job in `ci.yml` and `govulncheck.yml` is green on the head". B1 updates `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md` and `handoffs/HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md` in the same PR, so the documents never state a rule CI does not run.

## D4-4: rulings for the C10 draft (P4-A4)

Date: 2026-10-27. Sources: B4's ack (#229), A4's answers on #229, and B6's ack (#222).

1. **Clock.** C10 follows the clock rule in `docs/verification.md`, "R4.8 observation period and measures": received time by default, and device time for the time-of-day rule only when the offset is known. The alarm names the clock it used. The brief's wording stays, because it defers to that text.
2. **SER catch-up.** Rows of the first successful read after a recorded V-S12 failure, and rows aligned `gap-before`, count toward the type set but not toward rate and hour learning. Rate and time rules skip them; the new-type and repeats rules still apply. Every row of one read shares one `received.utc`, so the SER rate bucket is at least the collection interval, or the rate rule counts per read.
3. **`possible-duplicate`.** A row flagged `possible-duplicate` is checked against the previous read only, matched one to one: k identical rows in the previous read suppress at most k rows. Rows are never compared within the current read. B6 tests whatever C10 states.
4. **The Syslog event-type key.**
   - Facility and severity come from `pri`. A message whose PRI cannot be parsed gets the fixed key `pri-absent`.
   - The template is `msg` with every digit run replaced.
   - `app_name` and the tag are not part of the key.
   - The digit rule merges RTAC tags that differ only by a number. C10 states this as a limit. A dialect rule may follow in a later C10 minor if B6's tests or a real capture show that the merge hides a distinction that matters.
5. **The baseline hash** that `node.baseline_ack` names is SHA-256 over the stored record's exact bytes, with no canonical JSON. This follows C7's exact-bytes precedent. B3 reviews it beside C7 0.6.

## D4-5: the Windows Go timeouts are tracked, not waved through (#230)

Date: 2026-10-27.

**What failed.** At least three Windows `go` jobs on docs-only heads hit `go test`'s 600 s package timeout in `platform/node`:
- 122345921404;
- 122347974504;
- 122364514991.

B5's ack also names job 122364490231.

**B6's reading.** B6's analysis is in the project files, `b6/windows-go-timeouts-2026-10-27.md`. It reads these as slow disks across every disk-bound package, not one hung flush.
- `platform/node` normally uses 53 to 76 percent of the 600 s budget.
- This reading is an inference, and `platform/store`'s 9-minute case is unclassified.

**Rulings.**
- None of these is a flake.
- No `ci.yml` change (`-timeout`, `-p`, a split, or the job's 15-minute limit) until B5 reports per-test Windows times for `platform/node` and `platform/store` and proposes a fix.
- B6 runs an ETW-timed `FlushFileBuffers` check in an `a6-*` workflow.
- Fixed wall-clock bounds become waits on progress:
  - `TestListenerUsesSizedBudget` and `flood` (B5);
  - the syslogreceive rig (B6, #232). The rig keeps its 15 s close bound because, after Grace, there is no further progress to wait on, but on a late return it now reports when `Serve` actually returned.

## D4-6: the Phase 3 carried checks are released to B6

Date: 2026-10-27.

**The checks**, which run on the GitHub-hosted runner, not the owner's PC:
- the canary scan of process command lines;
- the DMY and YMD slice reconcile on the real binaries;
- the unknown-restart leg on Windows;
- the admin relay with `config\admin`'s ACLs on Windows.

**`a6-windows-slice.yml`.** B6 may add it under B6's own `a6-*.yml` ownership, on two conditions:
- its `pull_request` trigger is limited to the slice and harness paths;
- B1 is told when it lands.

A run that installs services stays on the hosted runner. B5 reviews it, because it drives B5's service-mode harness.

## D4-7: order of the open A5 PRs and Go 1.27.3

Date: 2026-10-27.

**The open PRs.**
- B5 brings #176 and #182 up to current `main` now, by merging and never by rebasing. They do not wait for the toolchain PR.
- Whichever lands first, the other merges `main` again.
- #176, #177 and #182 each need all ten CI jobs green on their own head before merge, and #182 needs B6's fresh measurement of the record bound on a worst-case record. Per B5's ack, that record adds:
  - a TLS leaf;
  - `asset_id` and its binding;
  - an IPv6 sender.

**Go 1.27.3** is one PR under D3-10.
- B1 writes it, because it owns `go.mod`.
- B3 and B6 review it.
- B6 repeats the Windows UDP stress test on 1.27.
- B5 compares `platform/node` and `platform/store` times against the 1.26.10 baseline.
- It is never auto-merged.

## D4-8: items carried, not open

Date: 2026-10-27.

- **H-13.** B6 widens H-13, or adds a separate hardware item, to cover `SHO G`, each register revision 5 form and absent-option replies, and port-server `T_OUT` (B2's ack, #226 and #231). It stays prepared only and is not run.
- **Snapshot bytes.** A C9 snapshot holds each settings section's transcript span and SHA-256, with no second copy of the bytes. B2 and B5 agree how long transcripts are retained before C5 0.4 is drafted.
- **SEL-751 rung.** The SEL-751 stays on rung 3 (`SHO` over Telnet), as the brief's ADR-0008 decision 4 states. Q3 needs the owner's authorization and an out-of-service lab relay.
